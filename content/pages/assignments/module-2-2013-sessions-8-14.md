Study Lesson 14 Required Characters

We will start reading extra materials this semester. The content is challenging but don't be overwhelmed by it. I don't expect you to master it right away. The goal is to expose you to material relevant to your life and test your reading skills. We will not have any tests on these materials but a presentation. Following the steps below:

1.  Download the lesson of "Online Socializing (網上交友/网上交友)" from {{% resource_link 1a1feffb-eefd-09b4-bfbd-3630e69645be "Study Materials" %}}. Choose your own character version.
2.  Find the recording of the text of "Online Socializing." \[Note: This recording is not provided due to copyright restrictions\].
3.  Listen to the recording 2–3 times. Do not look at the text the first time when you listen and see how much you understand.
4.  Listen to the recording with the text the second or the third time. Circle the vocab that you don't know.
5.  Think about the following questions:
    1.  Do you use social media websites? Why?
    2.  Are there any disadvantages with using these social media websites? Why?

Get prepared for the group presentation (> 6 minutes), PowerPoint slides are required.

1.  Meet with your teammates and design a personal website for someone (could be a real person or a made-up person).
2.  The format of the website should be similar to our text 網上交友/网上交友. Your presentation should cover 4 things:
    1.  Personal information;
    2.  Self-introduction;
    3.  The person's current mood and reason for looking for friends;
    4.  Use at least 5 new words from the vocabulary of the text.
3.  When you present it, don't read from your PowerPoint Slides. Pretend that you are an agent who is trying to introduce this person to his / her potential friend. Everyone needs to present.
4.  Be ready for questions from your classmates.

\*The grading criteria are listed in the {{% resource_link f3a9b87f-ae46-19ac-c22e-26e53776f5b9 "Syllabus" %}}. Send your PowerPoint Slides to your instructor and indicate who is responsible for which part.
