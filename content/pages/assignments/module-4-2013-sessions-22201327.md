For example, if you are computer major, write the essay on Apply that could relate to your major. You might need to use new vocabulary and there are several online dictionaries in {{% resource_link 7386c1f2-653a-8c0f-935f-5674e8c65c7e "Tools / Resources" %}}. For example, [海词](http://dict.cn).

Pay special attention to the over-all structure of your composition and use as many new words and sentence patterns as possible.
