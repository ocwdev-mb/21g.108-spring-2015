Study Lesson 16 Required Characters

The content is challenging but don't be overwhelmed by it. I don't expect you to master it right away. The goal is to expose you to material relevant to your life and test your reading skills. We will not have any tests on these materials but a presentation. Following the steps below:

1.  Download the lesson of "Dinner 晚餐." Choose your own character version.
2.  Find the recording of the text of "Dinner" under the text of "晚餐" \[Note: This recording is not provided due to copyright restrictions\].
3.  Listen to the recording 2–3 times. Do not look at the text the first time when you listen and see how much you understand.
4.  Listen to the recording with the text the second or the third time. Circle the vocab that you don't know.
5.  Bring the text to the class.
6.  Think about the following questions:
    1.  In the U. S. will kids normally follow parents' wish to choose a college and a major?
    2.  What were your parents' concerns when you chose a college and a major?
    3.  From this play, what does Chinese parents expect from their children? How does that play into Confucianism?

3.  Provide an ending to the play. The length will be no less than 150 characters.
