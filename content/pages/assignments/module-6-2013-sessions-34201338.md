Important: You should start thinking about your end-of-term essay now. Don't forget to finish the BFA project by its deadline.

The next two lessons are from a different textbook, _Oh China!_, and the language and vocabulary are very different from 大學語 文 / 大学语文 , and somewhat challenging. We will focus on two different genres, one is online blog and the other one is a prominent historical figure Rong Hong. The content is challenging but don't be overwhelmed by it. I don't expect you to master it right away. The goal is to expose you to material relevant to your life and test your reading skills. We will not have any tests on these materials but a presentation.

Choose your own character version of "Xi'an Travel 西安自助旅游." and follow the steps below:  

1.  Listen to the recording \[Note: This recording is not provided due to copyright restrictions\].
2.  Listen to the recording 2–3 times. Do not look at the text the first time when you listen and see how much you understand.
3.  Listen to the recording with the text the second or the third time. Circle the vocabulary that you don't know.
4.  Bring the text to the class.
5.  Think about the following questions:
    1.  Do you like traveling? Name one or two great places you have visited.
    2.  Before traveling to a place, what would you do to learn about the destination? What aspects would you want to know about?
    3.  What are your top priorities when you plan a trip?
