The focus of the course is on standard usage, on reading in both traditional and simplified characters, and on writing. The course is conducted entirely in Chinese.\n\nStreamlined I and II\u2014each section is limited to 16 students for pedagogical purposes. Pre-registered students have priority. Continuing students get first priority, followed, in order, by students in 21G.076, declared concentrators and minors, sophomores, freshmen, juniors, seniors, and graduate students. Pre-registered students who did not show up for the first two days of class without warning will be eliminated. Students beginning their studies of Chinese language at MIT above the elementary level must contact the Chinese instructors for a placement test. No auditors allowed.\n",
